# Branching

Here are our branching requirements:

- `main` is always a production-ready branch;
- every change to the codebase is made through a separate feature branch.

Each feature branch should be based on `main` to make the merge commits clear.

Creation of a feature branch on top of another feature branch should be avoided.

## Branch naming

Use the lowercase letters and `-` as a separator in the branch name.
